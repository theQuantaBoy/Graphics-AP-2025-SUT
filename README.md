# 🌘 20 Minutes Till Dawn – Java LibGDX Game Project

## 📘 Project Overview

A complete, custom-built 2D game developed in **Java** using the **LibGDX** framework, inspired by *20 Minutes Till Dawn*. This was created as the graphics-focused final project for the **Advanced Programming** course in the **Computer Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology** (Spring 2025, Term 2).

The project features a polished user interface, dynamic combat system, multiple enemies with AI behavior, upgradeable abilities, persistent save system, multilingual support, and animated visual effects — all designed and implemented following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture.
